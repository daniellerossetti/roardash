/*
 Check here for all the pre-coding stuff I did to this file! Storyboard, etc.
 - About this project
    This project holds all the code for the lion animation, which will be merged with the start code. It is a game application.
 - Storyboarding 
    There was no storyboarding required for this project.
 - Other prep stuff
    I dragged and dropped the lion_icon and user_icon pngs from the Running screen project.
