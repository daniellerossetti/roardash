 - About this project
    This project holds all the files needed to run our app. This is what we will be showing as the results of our efforts. 
 - Storyboarding & other set-up stuff 
    The first thing I did was delete the existing Game View Controller because we don't want it right now. I then created two new view controllers and named one Start Screen (which will hold the start button) and another the Running Screen (which will have our lion animation). 
    I then dragged the ViewController.swift file from the StartScreen project into this project and changed the class of the Start Screen View Controller to ViewController, linking the screen and this view controller. I created a button called "Tap to start ROARDASH" and connected this button via Show Detail Segue to the RunningScreen. 
    I then replaced all the code in the GameScene.swift in this project with the code from GameScene.swift in the LionAnimation.
    I then changed the class name of the RunningScreen View Controller to the GameViewController, linking it to the GameViewController.
