 Check here for other pre-coding actions I did! The storyboard stuff, etc.
 - About this project:
 This project will hold all the code for the Start Screen, which will then be merged with the lion animation. 
 It is a single view application. 
 
 - Storyboard Stuff:
 In the storyboard I created two View Controllers; the first one holds the Start Screen with the start button, and the screen is (for now) a placeholder for the running screen.
 In the first view controller, I added a button called Tap to Start Roardash. 
 In the second view controller, I added a label that describes briefly what the screen is: a placeholder where the animation, timer and other such details will be.
 I then connected the Tap to Start Roardash button to the second View Controller. 
 
 There was no other code required.
